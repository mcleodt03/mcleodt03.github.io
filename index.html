			Quick start Tips:</p>

			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					tap anywhere to move. You can pan around the map for longer walks.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					You should talk to people in town who have a &ldquo;?&rdquo; over their head since they give quests.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					The crypt entrance is at the top of the hill to the northeast of town. Tap on the building to enter the crypt.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					In general tapping on items or stairs will interact with them (tapping items will prompt you with the pick up screen and tapping stairs will ask if you want to go up or down them).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					Long press (i.e. holding finger down on a tile) will cause you to move there without interacting with the objects there (i.e. if you want to move into a tile containing items but do not want to pick them up).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					The quick buttons allow you to use your powers or other items quickly. Pressing the edit powers button lets you change the order or add and remove powers and items from the quick buttons.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					The Edit Attacks button allows you to change your default attack (i.e. the power you use when you just tap on a monster. It must be a minor power (no cool down) so not all powers are allowed, the default is basic attack which is not as good as any of the other powers you might have chosen first, unless you are a mage, in which case you won&#39;t use the default power much. You can also change your default ranged attack.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					To wear magic items, you need to identify them first. You can do so with a scroll of Identify or by talking to the Magic shop merchant in the south east part of town (she will offer to identify all your items if you have any unidentified items, or you can buy scrolls of identify from her if you don&#39;t have enough money to identify them all).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					Be cautious and learn how your powers work! You have as much time as you want to decide what to do each turn, so think strategically rather than just tapping as fast as you can.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					If you fall prone or are immobilized by a trap, just tap on yourself to rest or to stand up.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					You can purchase healing potions from Aria, the potion merchant in the east side of town. Healing potions are probably one of the best uses of the money you start with. You can also choose some powers and skills that let you heal in certain conditions as well (warriors have more of these).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 3px;">
					There is a warrior and a mage class and within each class there are different builds. In addition you can train skills from both classes and become a warrior mage or mage warrior (depending on which skill was trained first). You can reset your training at any time and rebuild your character differently, so don&#39;t be afraid to experiment.</p>
